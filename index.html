        <h1>The Hard Stuff</h1>
        <p>
            I think I had understood the idea of the concepts, like functions
            and loops ect, but I struggled with the logic and when to use
            certain variables.
        </p>
        <h1>Action Plan</h1>
        <p>
            To improve I plan on practicing more coding through online websites
            like Coursera and Freecodecamp. I will also try to watch more
            educational videos on Youtube when I get stuck.
